🔻 You’ve Reached a Dead End... Or Have You? 🔻

The air is thick with silence. This place feels significant, but something is... off. You search for answers, but they slip through your fingers like whispers in the wind.

A faded message appears before you:

"The path you seek is hidden, yet you have strayed into the void. The truth lies elsewhere. Retrace your steps, sharpen your sight, and seek again..."

🔄 Try again. The real answer is still out there.
